# Coinbase

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/coinbase/coinbase-ruby.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/coinbase/coinbase-ruby)

An easy way to buy, send, and accept [bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) through the [Coinbase API](https://coinbase.com/docs/api/overview).

This gem uses the [api key authentication method](https://coinbase.com/docs/api/overview) which is an easy way to get started if you only need to connect to your own Coinbase account.  If you need other users to grant your application access, you may want to try an OAuth2 integration instead using the [OAuth2 Ruby Gem](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2) as a starting point.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'coinbase'

Then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coinbase

## Usage

Start by [enabling an API Key on your account](https://coinbase.com/account/integrations).

Next, create an instance of the client and pass it your API Key as the first (and only) parameter.

```ruby
coinbase = Coinbase::Client.new(ENV['COINBASE_API_KEY'])
```

Notice here that we did not hard code the API key into our codebase, but set it in an environment variable instead.  This is just one example, but keeping your credentials separate from your code base is a good [security practice](https://coinbase.com/docs/api/overview#security).

Now you can call methods on `coinbase` similar to the ones described in the [api reference](https://coinbase.com/api/doc).  For example:

```ruby
coinbase.balance
=> #<Money fractional:20035300000 currency:BTC>
coinbase.balance.format
=> "200.35300000 BTC"
coinbase.balance.to_f
=> 200.353
```

[Money objects](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money) are returned for most amounts dealing with currency.  You can call `to_f`, `format`, or perform math operations on money objects.

## Examples

### Check your balance

```ruby
coinbase.balance.to_f
=> 200.353 # BTC amount
```

### Send bitcoin

```ruby
r = coinbase.send_money 'user@example.com', 1.23
r.success?
=> true
r.transaction.status
=> 'pending' # this will change to 'complete' in a few seconds if you are sending coinbase-to-coinbase, otherwise it will take about 1 hour, 'complete' means it cannot be reversed or canceled
r.transaction.id
=> '501a1791f8182b2071000087'
r.transaction.recipient.email
=> 'user@example.com'
r.to_hash
=> ... # raw hash response
```

You can also send money in [a number of currencies](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ruby/blob/master/supported_currencies.json).  The amount will be automatically converted to the correct BTC amount using the current exchange rate.

```ruby
r = coinbase.send_money 'user@example.com', 1.23.to_money('AUS')
r.transaction.amount.format
=> "0.06713955 BTC"
```

The first parameter can also be a bitcoin address and the third parameter can be a note or description of the transaction.  Descriptions are only visible on Coinbase (not on the general bitcoin network).

```ruby
r = coinbase.send_money 'mpJKwdmJKYjiyfNo26eRp4j6qGwuUUnw9x', 2.23.to_money("USD"), "thanks for the coffee!"
r.transaction.recipient_address
=> "mpJKwdmJKYjiyfNo26eRp4j6qGwuUUnw9x"
r.transaction.notes
=> "thanks for the coffee!"
```

### Request bitcoin

This will send an email to the recipient, requesting payment, and give them an easy way to pay.

```ruby
r = coinbase.request_money 'client@example.com', 50, "contractor hours in January (website redesign for 50 BTC)"
r.transaction.request?
=> true
r.transaction.id
=> '501a3554f8182b2754000003'
r = coinbase.resend_request '501a3554f8182b2754000003'
r.success?
=> true
r = coinbase.cancel_request '501a3554f8182b2754000003'
r.success?
=> true
# from the other account
r = coinbase.complete_request '501a3554f8182b2754000003'
r.success?
=> true
```

### List your current transactions

Sorted in descending order by timestamp, 30 per page.  You can pass an integer as the first param to page through results (for example `coinbase.transactions(2)`).

```ruby
r = coinbase.transactions
r.current_page
=> 1
r.num_pages
=> 7
r.transactions.collect{|t| t.transaction.id }
=> ["5018f833f8182b129c00002f", "5018f833f8182b129c00002e", ...]
r.transactions.collect{|t| t.transaction.amount.format }
=> ["-1.10000000 BTC", "42.73120000 BTC", ...]
```

Transactions will always have an `id` attribute which is the primary way to identity them through the Coinbase api.  They will also have a `hsh` (bitcoin hash) attribute once they've been broadcast to the network (usually within a few seconds).

### Check bitcoin prices

Check the buy or sell price by passing a `quantity` of bitcoin that you'd like to buy or sell.  This price includes Coinbase's fee of 1% and the bank transfer fee of $0.15.

```ruby
coinbase.buy_price(1).format
=> "$17.95"
coinbase.buy_price(30).format
=> "$539.70"
```


```ruby
coinbase.sell_price(1).format
=> "$17.93"
coinbase.buy_price(30).format
=> "$534.60"
```

### Buy or Sell bitcoin

Buying and selling bitcoin requires you to [link and verify a bank account](https://coinbase.com/payment_methods) through the web app first.

Then you can call `buy!` or `sell!` and pass a `quantity` of bitcoin you want to buy (as a float or integer).

On a buy, we'll debit your bank account and the bitcoin will arrive in your Coinbase account four business days later (this is shown as the `payout_date` below).  This is how long it takes for the bank transfer to complete and verify, although we're working on shortening this window.

On a sell we'll credit your bank account in a similar way and it will arrive within two business days.

```ruby
r = coinbase.buy!(1)
r.transfer.code
=> '6H7GYLXZ'
r.transfer.btc.format
=> "1.00000000 BTC"
r.transfer.total.format
=> "$17.95"
r.transfer.payout_date
=> 2013-02-01 18:00:00 -0800
```


```ruby
r = coinbase.sell!(1)
r.transfer.code
=> 'RD2OC8AL'
r.transfer.btc.format
=> "1.00000000 BTC"
r.transfer.total.format
=> "$17.93"
r.transfer.payout_date
=> 2013-02-01 18:00:00 -0800
```

### Create a payment button

This will create the code for a payment button (and modal window) that you can use to accept bitcoin on your website.  You can read [more about payment buttons here and try a demo](https://coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/payment_buttons).

The method signature is `def create_button name, price, description=nil, custom=nil, options={}`.  The `custom` param will get passed through in [callbacks](https://coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/callbacks) to your site.  The list of valid `options` [are described here](https://coinbase.com/api/doc/buttons/create.html).

```ruby
r = coinbase.create_button "Your Order #1234", 42.95.to_money('EUR'), "1 widget at â‚¬42.95", "my custom tracking code for this order"
r.code
=> "93865b9cae83706ae59220c013bc0afd"
r.embed_html
=> "<div class=\"coinbase-button\" data-code=\"93865b9cae83706ae59220c013bc0afd\"></div><script src=\"https://coinbase.com/assets/button.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>"
```

### Create a new user

```ruby
r = coinbase.create_user "newuser@example.com", "some password"
r.user.email
=> "newuser@example.com"
r.receive_address
=> "mpJKwdmJKYjiyfNo26eRp4j6qGwuUUnw9x"
```

A receive address is returned also in case you need to send the new user a payment right away.

## Adding new methods

You can see a [list of method calls here](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ruby/blob/master/lib/coinbase/client.rb) and how they are implemented.  They are a wrapper around the [Coinbase JSON API](https://coinbase.com/api/doc).

If there are any methods listed in the [API Reference](https://coinbase.com/api/doc) that don't have an explicit function name in the gem, you can also call `get`, `post`, `put`, or `delete` with a `path` and optional `params` hash for a quick implementation.  The raw response will be returned. For example:

```ruby
coinbase.get('/account/balance').to_hash
=> {"amount"=>"50.00000000", "currency"=>"BTC"}
```

Or feel free to add a new wrapper method and submit a pull request.

## Security Notes

If someone gains access to your API Key they will have complete control of your Coinbase account.  This includes the abillity to send all of your bitcoins elsewhere.

For this reason, API access is disabled on all Coinbase accounts by default.  If you decide to enable API key access you should take precautions to store your API securely in your application.  How to do this is application specific, but it's something you should [research](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/65601/is-it-smart-to-store-application-keys-ids-etc-directly-inside-an-application) if you have never done this before.
